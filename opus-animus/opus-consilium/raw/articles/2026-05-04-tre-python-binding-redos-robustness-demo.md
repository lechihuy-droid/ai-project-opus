        <p>If it's <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2026/May/4/redis-array/">good enough for antirez</a> to add to Redis I figured Ville Laurikari's <a href="https://github.com/laurikari/tre/">TRE</a> regular expression engine was worth exploring in a little more detail.</p>
<p>I had Claude Code build an experimental Python binding (it used <code>ctypes</code>) and try some malicious regular expression attacks against the library. TRE handles those much better than Python's standard library implementation, thanks mainly to the lack of support for backtracking.</p>
